## üå± Hobbies & Interests

Beyond software engineering, I have a deep appreciation for activities that bring balance and inspiration to my life.

- **Outdoor Exploration:** Hiking, camping, and fishing offer a way to disconnect, recharge, and immerse myself in nature‚Äôs beauty.  
- **Cacti & Sustainable Gardening:** I cultivate unique cacti species and practice regenerative farming, integrating sustainable agricultural methods that promote biodiversity and soil health.  
- **Homelab & Tech Experimentation:** I continuously refine and automate self-hosted infrastructure, experimenting with new technologies to improve performance and security while maintaining a robust environment for testing and learning.

## üèüÔ∏è Homelab Overview

My homelab is designed for **virtualization, container orchestration, automation,** and **continuous learning.** It serves as a platform to experiment with real-world infrastructure configurations and cutting-edge technologies.

### üîπ Key Components:
- **Virtualization Cluster** (Intel NUCs) ‚Äì Supporting VM workloads, high-availability experiments, and network simulations.  
- **Kubernetes Cluster** (Raspberry Pi) ‚Äì Running containerized applications, developing custom Kubernetes controllers, and managing microservices efficiently.  
- **Firewalls & Security** ‚Äì Implementing layered security with multiple firewalls, network segmentation, and advanced traffic filtering.  
- **Synology NAS Storage** ‚Äì Managing reliable backups, high-capacity data storage, and redundancy solutions for critical data.  
- **UPS & Power Backup** ‚Äì Ensuring stability and uptime during outages, preventing data loss, and protecting hardware investments.  
- **Essential Services** ‚Äì Running key applications such as Pi-hole (ad-blocking), AdGuard Home (DNS filtering), Jellyfin (media streaming), Homebridge (smart home integration), and other automation tools to streamline workflows and optimize the home environment.
